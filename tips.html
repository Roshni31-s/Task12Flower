                    <h3>Preparing Your Soil</h3>
                    <p>Healthy soil is the foundation of a beautiful garden. Test your soil's pH and amend it with compost or other organic matter to create the perfect growing environment for your flowers.</p>

                    <h3>Watering Techniques</h3>
                    <p>Water deeply but less frequently to encourage strong root growth. Early morning is the best time to water, as it reduces evaporation and helps prevent fungal diseases.</p>
